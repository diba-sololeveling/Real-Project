LabVIEW Versions: 2009

Dependencies: None

Description:

This is an OOP Framework that allows the development of By Reference Objects
with the capability to also be Active Objects.

By Reference capability is achieved by wrapping a DVR of the Data Members in a LVOOP Object.
An Active Object is one that has its own background process which is launched when the object
is instantiated. Active Objects are useful if your object requires time dependant characteristics.


Examples:

By Reference Object Demo

Demos\BikeDemo\Src\BikeDemo.vi

By Reference Active Object Demo

Demos\PumpDemo\Src\PumpDemo.vi
