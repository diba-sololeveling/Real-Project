# 🚀 LabVIEW Real-World Projects Portfolio

Welcome! 👋  

This repository is a curated collection of **real-world LabVIEW projects** that I have developed and used over the course of **10 years of professional work**.  
These projects were applied in **industrial, research, and hardware-integration environments**, making them practical examples rather than just tutorials.  

The goal of this portfolio is to:
- ✅ Share **proven, field-tested LabVIEW solutions**  
- ✅ Demonstrate expertise with **PXI, cRIO, EtherCAT, PROFINET, OPC UA, and database integration**  
- ✅ Provide a **learning resource** for LabVIEW developers and engineers  
- ✅ Showcase the **breadth of applications**, from UI/UX to real-time hardware control
